Marwan's C++ tool box
=====================

This is a place for some experimental work, useful or not, in C++. Most of the code here is (or will be)
    used somewhere, but they are not in production ready version, use at your own risk.

Currently available:

* `error_handling` : a naive incomplete implementation of an `Expected` type with monadic operations.
